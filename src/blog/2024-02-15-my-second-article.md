description: Knowing when to showcase your skills to the world is important. With all of this success people are having, there must exist a recipe. No matter how hard I work, sometimes a quiver of doubt slips in.

As I observe and listen, I notice the landscape of us new programmers have been tainted with the idea of inferority or anything in close comparision. It can be intimidating to enter the tech world and find your place. Most new coders are learning to program with the intent to find a new career and elevate their current lives. As the world keeps turning, technology seems to get more prominent by the day. How do you see yourself carving out your portion of the future?

Lately, I often find myself reminding me that I am not in competition with the current pace of technology. I stimulate my studies by imaging myself preparing for a job. Almost every essence of my being only can accept the idea of me learning to code as platform to build my own business and career. on the other hand, I feel like I should at least try to care about having a job as a coder to justify my hours and days I pour my energy into coding. In my truths, I wish to only work for myself and my mind has been made up. Then again, I also feel like I need a job to more adequately provide for my family. I could be lucky and find a way to provide for generations; chasing our currency is like running on a wheel. Like me, I am sure you can find many reasons to be motivated. Why then do you question your worth?

Seems to me, it's hard to claim your specific space. You may invent a new path but soon a flock comes up and dilutes your impact. Or the world seems to turn as soon as you find your place, and sweeps you off balance.
