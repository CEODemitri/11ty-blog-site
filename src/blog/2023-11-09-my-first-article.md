How easy life may pass us by revealing new paradigms by the moment. What does our future hold in this turbelent era? One thing for sure, I will be an assest to the future society.

<!-- TODO 1: rewrite this blog and write complete at the bottom of the page-->
<!-- for the first blog, my idea is to get the ball rolling with this site. I have a few plans to implement. this first blog must set the foundation for this iteration of the site(even though it will be seen last when listed, more personal) -->
<!-- topic: in the beginning: as coders what is our motivation, what may we accomplish, the state of the coding community -->
Entering into the tech field can be extremely competitive and at the same time or even more rewarding. Millions of people across the world have migrated to tech in hopes of staying current with the times. Observing the landscape we call home, society seems to be immersed in technology with the stragglers quickly adapting and adopting newer, modern methods to best serve their supporters. So it seems only right to align your skills as so leading an influx of brand new coders into the tech market. 

When I started my own journey, my spider senses never tingled concerning the number of new programmers and how many peers would arise. Communities all over the world have been growing and thriving for years even before my own migration. I assumed their would be a few of us at most. Despite the magnitudes of people, I have never thought of anyone as competition personally. We may be applying for the same job on the same day at the same time, completing our interview at the same time. No more then coincidence for me; what's meant will find a way to happen. Something similar to fate. I am happy for all of us and wish for all us to live the careers we wish and dream for.

The next shocker for me was the amount of prebuilt code. I had no intention of playing legos, in the terms of just stacking uilding blocks ontop of the others; again I assumed I would be like Steve Woziak, building from the ground up. I get it, all the Reacts and BootStraps. I definetly did not expect this paradigm either. And then the inevitable happened; the public introduction to easily accesible AI and other Maachine Learning tools.
