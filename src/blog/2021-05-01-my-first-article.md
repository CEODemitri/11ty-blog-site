description: A Challenge to myself to do something different. 
---

I think to the past and am inspired by the ingenuity, imagination and invention. The programmers before me have paved a wonderful path inspiring me to push the limits and make my own mark. How much more is left to discover; every day amazing coders develop new recipes making all of our jobs a bit easier. With the release of AI and Machine Learning a whole new terrain has been uncovered. I have always enjoyed a fiesty challenge. I do get joy from solving complex problems. 

Growing up, I never really used too much brain power; school was super easy even in the advanced classes. So I coasted even when I could push my limits and show a bit more. Coding has been my chance to really stretch my brain muscles. Now, learning in 2023, I thought I would find random people here and there trying to learn like me but I was amazed to find a whole community of communities full of people all over the world teaching themselves to code. How amazing. 

I believe the role of man is to invent and aspire; no need to repeat any generation because you build on from the next and grow. In my opinion, I refuse to believe this has been the height of civilization. Driving dinosaur cars with our delicate "fossil fuels", using dirty electricity to power many of our electronics; the lack of ineffeciency is disturbing to me. As powerful as we should be, our technology is slow and heavily bogged with bloatware. We, the majority, wait on a small minority to signal when it is time to elevate. We simply go with the flow. As for me, I am here to spark a revolution. 

Our civilization deserves a lot more. We are capable of accomplishing a lot more. I feel we are sedated and in some sort of trance. Our best intentions are not honored or even mentioned. How much longer will we sit idle, complaining amongst our selves with no obvious path to a resolution? How many more generations must we lead to subjegation to mediocracy? Many of us waste our potential focusing on the tiniest spaces: our small families, our tiny jobs, even our minitature aspirations. I have seen so much time go by with very littel progress, all curated every step of the way. 

Let us unlock our potential. Let us unlock our home. How much bright er would earth be if all us contributed to the light in the most magnificent way. There are millions of people who understand the passion I speak with; while a huge majority are on the other side. Too many of us. There does exist another way.
