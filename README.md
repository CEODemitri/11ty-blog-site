# JAMStack personal blog - codementor Challenge

I started this project using a template from Kevin Powell. My first site was simple, not as equipped as this one. I didn't plan my first build or even try too hard. Web Dev is not  complicated concept to me, but the lack of planning gave me no idea of what I was working on or towards. After a few days of fumbling, I decided to follow the instructions and use the starter files to focus on learning eleventy. With time, my builds will become more advanced but I need to push past this project. 

My plan is to revisit this project in around three months. I am a developer, I have the skills to build all things I direct my energy too. The hardest part for me is trying to make everything have a purpose. I enjoy working with SSG's and templating languages are quite intersesting. 

## Starter Files
I cloned Kevin Powell's repo and followed his youtube tutorial to gain better experience with this build. Even reading the docs, my build would have been lacking. I used sveltekit the first run, I believe. SO happy I used 11ty for this project. Excited and eager to build more.

## Project Build
Much more intricate a process then I assumed. Very detailed and easily configurable. About four or five days build. Easy to keep up, little to no bugs. Simple but thorough process.
