# JAMStack personal blog - starter files

I started this project and built the starter files myself. The site was simple, not as equipped as this one. I can do better. I decided to follow the instructions and use the starter files to focus on learning eleventy. With time, my build will become more advanced but I need to push past this project. 

## Starter Files
I cloned Kevin Powell's repo and followed his youtube tutorial to gain better experience this build. Even reading the docs, my build would have been lacking.
